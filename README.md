# 2018 gip domotica python
I made this as a yearlong project in my schoolyear 2017-2018
## Description
It is is a python script spesific to my hardware. It uses PyQt5 this is for a touchscreen on my Raspberry Pi. And OpenHAB as website control.

## Use
setup database with the sql.py file. Run execute.py( comunication program for comunication between hardware and ui ). then run ui.py file to show the ui. The .ui files are generated files from QtCreator that can be converted with the convert.bat file.

## Notes
Camera doesn't work in ui stil need to work on that.
